Your plan is ambitious but definitely feasible, assuming you take the time to optimize and debug each step. You're covering a lot of groundâ€”Vulkan for rendering, compute shaders for chunk generation, fast meshing algorithms, LOD, and an asynchronous/multi-threaded architecture. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of potential challenges, considerations, and optimizations:

---

### **Feasibility & Challenges**
1. **Vulkan Learning Curve**  
   Vulkan is significantly more complex than OpenGL, requiring you to manage memory, synchronization, and descriptor sets manually. Since youâ€™re also using compute shaders, youâ€™ll need to manage separate pipelines for graphics and compute workloads, which adds complexity. If you haven't used Vulkan properly before, expect a steep learning curve.

2. **Compute Shaders for Chunk Generation**  
   - Running chunk generation on the GPU is a great idea, but make sure you handle memory transfers efficiently.  
   - Use **persistent mapped buffers** or **staging buffers** to transfer data between the GPU and CPU.  
   - Consider **Sparse Bindings** if youâ€™re working with large worlds but only need small sections in memory.  
   - Since chunks will vary in complexity, **workgroup sizes and load balancing** might become a challenge.

3. **Greedy Meshing on the CPU**  
   - Your approach makes sense: Generate chunk data on the GPU â†’ send it to the CPU â†’ apply binary greedy meshing.  
   - If your world is large, meshing should be multi-threaded to avoid stalls. You might also want a **thread pool** that continuously meshes nearby chunks asynchronously.  
   - Since meshing results in large vertex buffers, **instancing or indirect drawing** might help for rendering efficiency.

4. **LOD System & Threaded Rendering**  
   - LOD selection will have to be **fast**. A good approach is to calculate chunk visibility (based on camera position) in a separate thread and prepare different LODs asynchronously.  
   - Consider **asynchronous compute queues** in Vulkan to allow GPU-based LOD selection without stalling rendering.  
   - **Bindless rendering** (descriptor indexing) can be useful if you need a flexible material/texture system.

5. **Physics Engine & Collision Detection**  
   - This part might be tricky, depending on your voxel format. AABB-based broad-phase collision detection is common for voxel engines, but the **narrow-phase resolution** (e.g., player sliding against voxel surfaces) can be tricky.  
   - If you plan to make destructible terrain, **Sparse Voxel Octrees (SVOs)** could be worth considering.  
   - If real-time physics is important, you may need **GPU physics acceleration** for large worlds.

6. **V-Sync Alternative & Motion Blur**  
   - Your plan to avoid V-Sync by rendering frames slightly out of order is interesting, but be careful of **temporal artifacts**.  
   - Motion blur helps, but ensure it's **velocity-based motion blur**, not screen-space blur, so that it looks smooth across frames.  
   - If timing and physics updates happen asynchronously, you might need **time-warping techniques** (similar to VR reprojection) to avoid inconsistencies.

7. **Ray Tracing (Path Tracing) Integration**  
   - Ray tracing in Vulkan is great but computationally expensive.  
   - Consider **ReSTIR (Reservoir Spatiotemporal Importance Resampling)** if you implement path tracingâ€”it improves sampling efficiency for real-time rendering.  
   - If you want hybrid rendering (traditional rasterization + ray tracing for reflections), **deferred rendering** works well with Vulkan.

### **Potential Optimizations**
- **Async Compute Pipelines:** Use **multiple Vulkan queues** to overlap compute and rendering work.  
- **Meshlet Rendering:** Instead of drawing entire chunks, use **meshlets** to reduce overdraw and improve LOD handling.  
- **GPU Culling:** If chunks contain lots of geometry, you can offload occlusion culling to the GPU using compute shaders.  
- **Clustered Rendering:** If you plan to add dynamic lights, clustered shading is more scalable than traditional forward rendering.

### **Overall Conclusion**
Yes, your plan is feasible, but Vulkanâ€™s complexity will be a significant hurdle. The biggest challenges will likely be:
1. **Managing multi-threading & synchronization** (especially for chunk generation and physics).  
2. **Efficient data transfers between CPU & GPU** (especially for meshing and collision detection).  
3. **Ensuring smooth frame pacing** despite the asynchronous architecture.  

If you approach it step-by-step, start simple, and gradually optimize, you can absolutely make this work! ðŸš€
